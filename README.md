# DONORLOOP!

## WHAT IS DONORLOOP
DonorLoop helps nonprofits build donor trust by transforming complex IRS 990 forms into clear, visual insights. Using Reagent to parse and analyze the I-990 form, the platform extracts key financial metrics and automatically generates intuitive dashboards for users to customize how they want to view their NGO's data. In addition, our interface allows users to create posts with the intention of updating their donors about their NGO.
